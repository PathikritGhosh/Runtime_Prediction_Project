# Runtime_Prediction_Project
Done as a part of Design Oriented Project in college. <br/>
Aim was to predict runtime of parallel programs. Used CUDA programs as input here. Done as a part of bigger project which aimed to predict energy consumption.<br/>
Achieved results which gave an error on runtimes of less than 10% when tested on Rodinia benchmarks.<br/>
